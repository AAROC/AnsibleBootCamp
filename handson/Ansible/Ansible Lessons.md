# Ansible Lessons

This directory contains the lesson plans for the Ansible  part of the bootcamp. Each lesson has it's own directory, which contains the description of the tasks to complete during the lesson, in markdown format, as well as supporting files such as inventory or playboook stubs, _etc_.

In order to do the course, go through the lesson description step by step, completing and ticking off tasks as you go. If there are questions, search for or start a topic on the forum linked to that lesson.
